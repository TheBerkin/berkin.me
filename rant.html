        <h1>What is Rant?</h1>
        <p>
          Rant is a language for procedurally generating text.
          It combines a markup language with functional and imperative programming concepts to deliver a powerful,
          but easy-to-use tool for adding rich variations to your text. The ultimate goal of Rant is to augment
          your creativity with the boundless potential of randomness, helping you consider your next great
          ideas as not just a static concept, but a seed for countless possibilities.

          <b>TL;DR:</b> It's pretty neat and you should try it.
        </p>
        <h1>Delightfully versatile.</h1>
        <p>
          Create character names for your games, generate the world's strangest novel, or randomize your website's CSS.
          The only limits are your imagination and your dignity.

        <h1>Features</h1>
        <h2>Branching</h2>
        <p>
          Add branching choices with optional weighting.
          Choose the selection strategy, or just leave it random.
          That's up to you.
        </p>
        <code class="block language-rant" data-src="static/txt/example1.txt"></code>

        <h2>Dictionary queries</h2>
        <p>
          You can load dictionaries into Rant and query them.
          This enables you to provide a large vocabulary to your patterns.
        </p>
        <code class="block language-rant" data-src="static/txt/example2.txt"></code>

        <h2>Automatic formatting</h2>
        <p>
          Want the output converted to Title Case and all your numbers written in binary? Me neither, but you can do it if your heart so desires.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rant provides many options for automatic capitalization, number formatting, indefinite article automation, and more.

        <h2>Repeaters</h2>
        <p>
          Repeaters are a feature of Rant that allow a designated subset of a pattern (called a block)
          to be run a set number of times with a defined behaviors called attributes. They're pretty nifty, especially for constructing lists.
